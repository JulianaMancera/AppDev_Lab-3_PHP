### Challenge 1
Create a multiplication table using a nested `for loop`. The table output should look like this:<br>

**Multiplication Table**
```
1 x 1 = 1 
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5
1 x 6 = 6
1 x 7 = 7
1 x 8 = 8
1 x 9 = 9
1 x 10 = 10
and so on...
```

### Challenge 2
Get the sum of the numbers in an array by using a foreach loop and for loop.

`$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; //sum using foreach loop`<br>
`$numbers2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6,7,8,9,19];  //sum using for loop`

**Sample Output** <br>
```
Sum array using foreach loop
15
Sum array using for loop
64
```

### Challenge 3

Calculate the average students grade from an array of students. Each student has their own array with the key `grades`. 

1. Create an array of students with their names and grades (0 - 100) <br>
        `john   85, 90, 92, 88` <br>
        `jane   95, 88, 91, 87` <br>
        `joe    75, 82, 79, 88` <br>

2. Iterate over the students array with a foreach loop
3. Calculate the average grade for each student.

**Sample Output** <br>
```
Average Grade 
John: Average Grade = 88.75 
Jane: Average Grade = 90.25 
Joe: Average Grade = 81
